					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p>Moscow. English speaking club. Muscovites meet native speakers in this club for money and talk on various topics for language practice. The owner of the club, American John, set his own rules in the club. The first rule of the club is to speak only English. The second rule of the club is that people over forty are not allowed to enter: this place is only for young people.</p>
					<p>Vasily appears in the club – he came to speak with his girlfriend Masha. A few days ago, he flared up and left her, and now he decided to return her back, but everything is not so simple. To return his beloved, forty-year-old Vasily will fight with English, which he studied at school a long time, as well as with John, who sets his own rules. And all – under close attention and with the participation of other members of the club.</p>
